## Overview

**Crawl_Trace** is a Python-based tool that automatically detects, traces, and characterizes **levee-like** or **channel-like** linear landforms from **high-resolution LiDAR** data.  
It operates on a **1000 m × 1000 m** study tile centered at a user-defined location and employs a “crawling” algorithm that follows elevation gradients either **uphill** or **downhill**, depending on the selected tracing method.

### Applications
- Wetland restoration and reconnection studies  
- Hydrological modeling and floodplain analysis  
- Geomorphometric and terrain feature mapping  

---

## Background

Traditional methods for identifying levees and channels from LiDAR often rely on **manual interpretation** or **threshold-based filtering** of DEM derivatives (e.g., slope, curvature).  
**Crawl_Trace** introduces an adaptive, semi-randomized crawling algorithm that:

- Randomly seeds multiple starting points across the study tile  
- Analyzes the **local elevation gradient** and **orientation**  
- “Crawls” along ridge-like or depression-like paths  
- Produces **vectorized linear traces** representing potential geomorphic features  

This method balances **automation** and **interpretability**, making it suitable for **landscape-scale levee mapping** and **wetland hydrological connectivity** research.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python **3.9+** installed.

### Required Libraries

```bash
pip install numpy geopandas matplotlib shapely rasterio pdal tqdm
````

> Note: PDAL must be properly installed and accessible in your environment.
> For system-level installation, visit: [https://pdal.io/download.html](https://pdal.io/download.html)

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaweedNazary/Crawl_Trace.git
cd Crawl_Trace
```

---

## Example Usage

```python
from crawl_trace import Crawl_Trace

features = Crawl_Trace(
    location=(-10523769.57, 4719384.06),
    N=100,
    min_height=0.5,
    max_height=50.0,
    window_size=(100.0, 5.0),
    D=20.0,
    r=20.0,
    resolution=1,
    method=1,
    random_seed=59
)

# The result is a GeoDataFrame of traced features
print(features.head())
```

**Crawl_Trace** retrieves LiDAR data for the specified location, initializes random seeds, performs iterative terrain crawling, and returns a **GeoPandas GeoDataFrame** containing traced linear features with their attributes.

## Output Description

**Returns:** `GeoDataFrame`

Each record corresponds to a traced linear feature point and includes:

* Relative elevation
* Tracing method (uphill/downhill)
* Feature height
* Directional anisotropy
* Normalized anisotropy
* Orientation angle (radians)

*Future versions will include attributes such as flow accumulation, leveed area, and feature confidence level.*

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Coordinate System:** Ensure inputs are in **EPSG:3857** (units in meters).
2. **Divide Study Area:** Split your study region into **1000 × 1000 m tiles**.
3. **Parameter Tuning:** Calibrate parameters (`r`, `window_size`, `N`, `min_height`) on one test tile.
4. **Validation:** Overlay results on DEM or hillshade layers to visually confirm accuracy.
5. **Cross-Check:** Compare with existing datasets (e.g., **National Levee Dataset**).

> **Tip:** The algorithm often detects levees not listed in NLD — this is expected and beneficial for restoration studies.

## Troubleshooting

| Error / Issue                         | Possible Cause                      | Suggested Fix                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ValueError: Invalid parameter types` | Incorrect coordinate format         | Ensure `location` uses `(x, y)` in EPSG:3857 |
| No features detected                  | Parameters too restrictive          | Decrease `min_height` or increase `N`        |
| Trace ends prematurely                | DEM too coarse or sparse            | Increase `r` or check LiDAR point density    |
| PDAL pipeline failure                 | Incorrect file path or missing data | Verify LiDAR availability and CRS            |
